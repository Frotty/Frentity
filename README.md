# Frentity
*short fort Frotty's Entity System*

Frentity is a lightweight entity framework which I use as basis for all my maps.
It comes with Entity base classes for Units and Effects that allow positional and velocital manipulation via 3d vector math.
Additionaly there are some useful wurst wrappers for Buffs to automatically generate objects based off tornado aura, a damage modifier, Event system, LZW de/encode, etc.
