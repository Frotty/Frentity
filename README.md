## About

Frentity is a lightweight entity framework which I use as basis for all my maps.
Its main feature are the Entity base classes for Units, Effects and Items, that allow positional and velocital manipulation via 3d vector math.
Additionally it contains some neat wrapper and bootstrap features that make map development more rapid and integrated.
